        // You might think we can just do something like this:

        // now here is the problem!
        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point tothe    same array!
        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        // one day
        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        // or use the new ES6 Spread

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
        // with Objects
        const person = {
          name : 'Pat Smith',
          age : 24,
          friends:['Rose','Martin']
        }
        // and think we make a copy:
        // how do we take a copy instead?
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const male = Object.assign({},person,{work:'teacher'}) // Only Level Deep!!!
        console.log(person,male)
        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it
        const female = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
